Python is a an interesting language with many neat features like whitespace aware stuff and it's really good and stuff

```python
    class p:
        def __init__(self, something_else):
            self.name = something_else
```

Wow that's a really interesting thing isn't it. Very neat and informative!

# Kotlin

Kotlin is effectively a better Java in just about every way I can think of. It allows for named parameters, easier to use lambdas and even inferred typing

```kotlin
    class wow {

    }
    var l: String;
```
